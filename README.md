# Evaluate

This repository is NOT A SECURE IMPLEMENTATION!

You should be using [SES](https://github.com/Agoric/SES) or
[realms-shim](https://github.com/Agoric/realms-shim) to call `evaluate`
with secure control of global variables.

This repository contains a stub implementation of evaluate.  If you really
need it, you will know, and you are on your own.
